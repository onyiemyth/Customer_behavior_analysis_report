 **Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis — Data Analytics Project**
 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to explore customer behavior, clean and prepare the dataset, run SQL queries using PostgreSQL, and create a clear visual report. A final presentation was created using Gamma.

** Dataset**

Source: Provided CSV dataset

Contents: Customer details, transaction data, product categories, purchase behavior, shipping type, and order amounts

Size: X rows × X columns (you can update this later)

 **Tools & Technologies**

Python (jupyter) – Data loading, EDA, data cleaning

PostgreSQL + pgAdmin 4 – SQL queries, database creation

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, dashboard creation

Gamma.app – Final presentation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

 **Project Steps**
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Checked structure, data types, missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Visualizations (distributions, correlations, customer trends)

Identified key patterns in customer purchases

3. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Fixed inconsistent data types

Created new calculated fields (purchase frequency, total amount, etc.)

4. SQL Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Created a database and schema

Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL

Executed SQL queries for deeper analysis
(e.g., most purchased categories, customer frequency, shipping type trends)

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL

Built a data model

Designed an interactive dashboard with KPIs, filters, and visual insights

Included metrics such as revenue trends, purchases by category, and customer patterns

6. Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized insights and results

Included visual storytelling for stakeholders and recruiters

 **Dashboard Highlights**

Total Sales & Monthly Trends

Customer Purchase Frequency

Top 5 Product Categories

Shipping Type Analysis

Interactive filters for customer segments, date, and category

**Key Results & Insights**

Identified the highest-performing product categories

Found customer groups with strong recurring purchase behavior

Discovered shipping preferences and their impact on total sales

Highlighted operational inefficiencies and improvement areas# Customer_behavior_analysis_report
Used Python,SOL and Power BI to analyse 3900 purchases to make business decision in Data analytics
